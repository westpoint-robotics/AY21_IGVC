### Launching Current Project
* Navigate to primary working directory: >Home/Desktop/igvc/catkin_ws/src/ay21_igvc_catkin/src/igvc_sw
* roslaunch master.launch

### Getting ROS to recognize a new workspace (for example, catkin_ws):
* In terminal, run 'sudo gedit ~/.bashrc'
* At the bottom of the file, add the line 'source [YOUR PATH]/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash'
* Save and exit, then new terminal windows

### Getting darknet to run on a ROS machine:

* In terminal, run 'sudo gedit /etc/ld.so.conf.d/darknetLib.conf'
* Then, paste the path to the libdarknet.so file, e.g., '/home/user1/catkin_ws/src/AY20_IGVC/src/object_recognition/darknet_test'
* Save and exit, then run 'sudo ldconfig' in the terminal.
* Now new terminal windows will work with it.

### Running whiteline controller:
* In terminal, run 'fm_camera.launch'
* In terminal, run 'whiteline_detector.py'
* In terminal, run 'whiteLineController.py'
* In terminal, run appropriate rosbag (I suggest IGVCStopsSign.bag) 'rosbag play bagfile'
* In terminal, run 'rostopic echo /speed_applied'

### Running lane finder and following controller:
* In terminal, run 'fr_camera.launch'
* In terminal, run 'rightLaneDetector.py'
* In terminal, run 'steeringController.py'

### Running darknet controller:
* In terminal, run 'roscore'
* In terminal, run 'darknet.py'
* In terminal, run 'signController.py'
* In terminal, run appropriate rosbag (I suggest IGVCStopsSign.bag) 'rosbag play bagfile'
* In terminal, run 'rostopic echo /detection_status'

### Final Stop Sign Detection Stuff:
* Follow above insrtuctions for whiteline and darknet controller
* In terminal, run 'constVelocity.py'
* The vehicle should now send brake commands to pacmod as is appropriate

### Launching the main package:

* Run 'roslaunch AY20_IGVC gem_e2.launch
